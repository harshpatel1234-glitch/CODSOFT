# 🔐 Task 3: Password Generator (Python)

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to create a password generator application
using Python that generates strong and random passwords based on user input.

## 📖 Description
A password generator is a useful tool that helps users create secure
passwords. In this project, the user specifies the desired password length,
and the program generates a random password using a combination of
letters, numbers, and special characters.

## ✨ Features
- 🔢 User can specify the password length
- 🔤 Uses uppercase and lowercase letters
- 🔣 Includes numbers and special characters
- 🔄 Generates a random and strong password every time
- ⚠️ Validates minimum password length

## 🛠️ Approach
- Took password length as input from the user
- Used a combination of letters, digits, and special characters
- Applied randomness to select characters
- Generated a password of the specified length
- Displayed the generated password on the screen

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Learned how to use randomization in Python
- Understood the importance of password security
- Practiced working with strings and user input
- Improved logical thinking and problem-solving skills
