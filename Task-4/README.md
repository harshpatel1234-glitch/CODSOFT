# ✊✋✌️ Task 4: Rock–Paper–Scissors Game 
## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to create a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game
using Python where the user plays against the computer.

## 📖 Description
This project is a command-line based Rock–Paper–Scissors game.
The user selects one option (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer
randomly chooses its option. The winner is decided based on predefined rules,
and the result is displayed clearly.

## 🕹️ Game Rules
- ✊ Rock beats ✌️ Scissors  
- ✌️ Scissors beat ✋ Paper

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 User can choose rock, paper, or scissors
- 🤖 Computer makes a random selection
- ⚖️ Determines win, lose, or tie correctly
- 🔄 Option to play the game again
- 💬 Clear and user-friendly messages

## 🛠️ Approach
- Took user input and converted it to lowercase for consistency
- Used random selection for the computer's choice
- Applied conditional logic to determine the game result
- Displayed both user and computer choices
- Asked the user whether to play another round

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Improved understanding of conditional statements
- Learned how to use randomness in Python
- Practiced handling user input effectively
- Built a simple interactive game using core Python concepts
