# Task 1: To-Do List Application

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a simple To-Do List application
using Python that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently.

## Description
This application allows the user to add, view, and remove tasks.
The program runs in a loop and updates the task list based on user input.
It is designed to be simple, clear, and easy to use.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- Display all existing tasks
- Remove a task using its number
- Handles invalid input properly

## Approach
- Used a Python list to store tasks
- Displayed the task list before each action
- Took user input to perform operations like add and remove
- Used conditional statements and loops to control the program flow

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Learning Outcome
- Gained a better understanding of Python lists
- Improved logic-building skills
- Learned how to handle user input and errors
- Practiced writing clean and readable code
